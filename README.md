# PEZ's very unfinished AOC 2024

To use as a starter for your Advent of Code adventure, know that there is very little here. =) The most important [util.clj](src/aoc/util.clj) function is the memoized `fetch-input`.

0. Paste your session cookie (from the dev tools on https://adventofcode.com) content in `.aoc-session` in the root of the repo. Only the value part.
1. Read your input. E.g. `(util/fetch-input 2024 1)`

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-3wGIYLXlg for a demo of solving Day 1 (major spoiler alert).
